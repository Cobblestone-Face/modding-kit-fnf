A modding kit for Friday Night Funkin'!



Okay, so about the autocharter.
When you are trying to automatically chart the song, you'll need a file called a midi file, or mid file. Channel 1 is always Boyfriend, and Channel 2 is always the opponent.
Make sure when you save the file, you gotta save the midi (or mid) without the background isntrumental FIRST, then put the instrumental back in, and save in as an ogg, or just use
a converter to change whatever it lets you save it as, to ogg (important).
